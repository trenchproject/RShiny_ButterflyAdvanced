<h3>Energy Budgets: Understanding the heat budget of montane butterflies</h3>

<h4>Seeing environments as organisms do</h4>

<p>Species and ecosystems continue to respond to climate change in unexpected ways– for example, shifting their distributions and abundances in directions opposite that expected. Such surprises highlight the need to translate our physical metrics of climates and climate change into how organisms are experiencing their environments. Differences in shape, coloration, and composition can lead two organisms to experience their shared environments very differently.</p>

<p>The body temperatures of both ectothermic (cold-blooded) and endothermic (warm-blooded) organisms can differ dramatically from air temperatures.  The body temperature of an ectotherm is determined by the exchange of heat with its environment. Endotherms additionally use endogenous heating to alter body temperatures. This means the endotherms produce heat internally to alter their body temperatures. </p>

<h4>Radiation: Reflection and Absorption</h4>

<p>A primary source of heat is the absorption of solar radiation. The physical properties of the surface of an organism are an important determinant of the amount of solar radiation absorbed. Albedo is a measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed, wherein darker surfaces absorb more heat.</p>

<p>A common example used to show the great importance of albedo is the ice-albedo feedback. Ice has a high albedo (thereby absorbing little heat from solar radiation). The ice cover on poles of the Earth keeps it cooler than open ocean or vegetation (which have lower albedos. However, global warming of the polar regions has begun melting our large ice sheets -- Antarctica and Greenland -- and the Arctic sea ice. As the polar region loses ice, it causes the albedo to decrease. A decrease in albedo means more solar radiation is absorbed, causing yet more melting of ice. And so it continues in what is termed a positive feedback loop.</p>

<h4>Heat and Temperature</h4>

<p>The body temperature of an organism is determined by balance of energy (heat) loss and gained from the environment. If an organism gains more heat from the environment that it loses, it will warm up. Think about what happens when you stand in the sunshine on a bright day. When you stand under the sunshine, you are gaining more heat from the sun than you are losing so you warm up. There are different forms of heat flow, but the basic concept is that heat is exchanged via diffusion -- which you may recognize from chemistry classes as the movement from high to low concentration. In the case of heat, the movement is from high temperature to low temperature. Heat moves from warm to cold.  Think about what happens when you hold a chocolate bar.</p>

<p>Temperature and heat are related terms that are sometimes used interchangeably, but they have different meanings.  Here’s a thought question you should try before moving on: define temperature and heat.</p>

<p>A bit tricky?  Temperature is the average energy of molecular motion in a substance whereas heat is the total energy of molecular motion.</p>

<h4>Forms of Heat Flow</h4>

<p>There are four primary types of heat flow that determine the body temperature or organism:</p>

<p><b>Radiation</b>: A heat transfer between two substances that are not in contact. The largest source of heat in most cases in the absorption of solar radiation. Animals radiate energy at a rate proportional to their body temperature (thermal radiation).</p>

<p><b>Conduction</b>: A heat transfer involving two objects in physical contact with each other. Organisms can alter rates of conduction by changing their amount of contact with surfaces.</p>

<p><b>Convection</b>: A heat transfer between a solid and a liquid or a gas. Wind and water speeds influence how much heat organisms exchange with their environments via convection.</p>

<p><b>Evaporation</b>: A loss of heat due to liquid water phase changing into gaseous water. Evaporation occurs when a fraction of water molecules have sufficient heat energy to escape a liquid. Organisms are cooled by evaporation until an equilibrium is reached where the air supplies the amount of heat removed by the evaporating water.</p>

<h4>Homeostasis and the influence of behavior</h4>

<img src="pika.png" width = "200px" align='right' />

<p>Organisms are adapted to function well over a relatively narrow range of body temperatures and other physiological conditions. Thus, organisms use physiological and behavioral processes to maintain relatively stable conditions, termed <b>homeostasis</b>, despite changes in their internal and external environments. </p>

<p>Many organisms use behavior change to maintain homeostasis with their environment. Have you ever tiptoed across hot sand or pavement to avoid heating up your feet? Fanned yourself after a work-out? These (and many more!) are behaviors humans do to maintain homeostasis. </p>

<br>
<h4>Net heat exchange with the environments</h4>

<p>A first step in understanding how organisms respond to their environment is to estimate how heat losses to and gains from the environment balance to determine the organism’s body temperature. Such a <b>biophysical model</b> is conceptually as simple as balancing a bank account, but the estimation of heat flows can be complicated. <b>Steady state</b> models describe the energy budget once the organism’s temperature has come to equilibrium with its environment, meaning that heat flow has stabilized.</p>

<p>An energy budget at the surface of an organism can be estimated as follows:</p>

<p align = "center">
𝑄𝑛𝑒𝑡 = 𝑄𝑎𝑏𝑠 − 𝑄𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑡 − 𝑄𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 − 𝑄𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑 − 𝑄𝑚𝑒𝑡 − 𝑄𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝,
</p>

where:<br>  
𝑄𝑛𝑒𝑡 is the net energy exchange with the environment (W), <br>
𝑄𝑎𝑏𝑠 is the solar and thermal radiation absorbed (W), <br>
𝑄𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑡 is the thermal radiation emitted (W), <br>
𝑄𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 is energy exchange due to convection (W), <br>
𝑄𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑 is energy exchange due to conduction (W), <br>
𝑄𝑚𝑒𝑡 is the energy emitted due to metabolism (W), and <br> 
𝑄𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝 is the energy emitted due to evaporative water loss (W).

<p>Rates of thermal radiation, conduction, convection are determined by the difference between the temperatures of the animal and its environment, so we can solve for the body temperature that balances the energy budget. We will omit heat exchanges via metabolism and evaporation in this exercise for simplicity and because they are often only minor components of an energy budget.</p>
