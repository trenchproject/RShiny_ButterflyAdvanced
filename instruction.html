We’ll use the visualization below to explore how changing the properties of a Colorado butterfly and its environment alters the energy budget and subsequently its body temperature. Try changing the weather, morphological (physical properties), and terrain variables to see how they affect daily variation in body temperature. <b>Environmental temperature</b> indicates air temperature and <b>operative temperature</b> indicates the estimated butterfly body temperature.

The plot shows the fluctuation of air temperature and butterfly body temperature throughout the day in Colorado. Check the "Show sidebar" to change the variables and observe how they affect the body temperature.<br>
In the 'Analysis' section, you can see the values of the three main components of heat exchange that occur on butterflies, which are <b>solar radiative</b>, <b>thermal radiative</b>, and <b>conductive</b> heat fluxes. By clicking on the plot, you can see the calculations and the responsible variables for each component of that specified hour in the 'Detailed analysis'.

For butterfly body temperature calculations, we use the <code>Tb_butterfly</code> function from the TrenchR package. 

Minimum and maximum daily temperatures are obtained at a weather station in Crested Butte, CO at the elevation of 2700m (38.9°, -107.0°).
