This shiny app visualizes the heat budget model of montane butterflies in further details with an interactive plot. The introduction and the questions guide you through some important physiological concepts in a digestable way.
The butterflies' body temperature is calculated based on a function from [TrenchR](https://github.com/trenchproject/TrenchR).
