We’ll use the visualization below to explore how changing the properties of a Colorado butterfly and its environment alters the energy budget and subsequently its body temperature. Try changing the weather, morphological (physical properties), and terrain variables to see how they affect daily variation in estimated body temperature (T body) and its relationship to air temperature (T air). Check the "Show sidebar" to change the variables and observe how they affect the body temperature.<br>
<br>
For <b>weather</b>, minimum and maximum daily temperatures are obtained for the most recent day available from a weather station in Crested Butte, CO at the elevation of 2700m (38.9°, -107.0°). You can alternatively specific temperatures manually. You can also specify windspeed and whether the sky is cloudy or clear. Wing coloration is an important component <b>morphology</b> that shapes their energy budget. If wings are darker, they absorb more solar radiation and heat the butterfly up. The diameter of the butterfly's thorax (main body segment) and the thickness of hair ("fur") on its body determine its heat retention. 
<br>
In the 'Analysis' section, you can see the values of the three main components of heat exchange that occur on butterflies, which are <b>solar radiative</b>, <b>thermal radiative</b>, and <b>conductive</b> heat fluxes. By clicking on the plot, you can see the calculations and the responsible variables for each component of that specified hour in the 'Detailed analysis'.

For butterfly body temperature calculations, we use the <code>Tb_butterfly</code> function from the TrenchR package.
