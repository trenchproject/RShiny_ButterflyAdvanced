The plot on the top shows the fluctuation of air temperature and butterfly body temperature throughout the day in Colorado. You can change the variable on the sidebar to observe how it affects body temperature.<br>
In the 'Analysis' section, you can see the values of the three main components of heat exchange that occur on butterflies, which are <b>solar radiative</b>, <b>thermal radiative</b> and <b>conductive</b> heat fluxes. By clicking an hour on plot, you can see the calculations and the responsible variables of each component of that specified hour in the 'Detailed analysis'.

For butterfly body temperature calculations, we use the <code>Tb_butterfly</code> function from the TrenchR package. 

Minimum and maximum daily temperatures are obtained at a weather station in Crested Butte, CO at the elevation of 2700m (38.9°, -107.0°).
